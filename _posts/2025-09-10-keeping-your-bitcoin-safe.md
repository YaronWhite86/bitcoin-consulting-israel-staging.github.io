## You Are The Bank

When you take self-custody of your Bitcoin, you become your own bank. This is incredibly empowering, but it means security is entirely in your hands. The good news is that following a few simple, non-technical rules will protect you from 99% of all potential threats.

Your security is entirely focused on one thing: protecting your **seed phrase** (also called a recovery phrase).

### ### What is a Seed Phrase?

The seed phrase is a list of 12 or 24 words that acts as the master key to your entire wallet. Anyone who knows these words can access your funds from anywhere in the world. Conversely, if you lose your phone or your hardware wallet breaks, you can use these words to recover all of your bitcoin on a new device. It is the most important piece of information you will own.

Here are the four golden rules of protecting it.

### ### Rule 1: Never Store It Digitally

Your computer and phone are connected to the internet and are vulnerable to hackers and malware. **NEVER** type your seed phrase into a computer, save it in a text file, email it to yourself, store it in a password manager, or, most importantly, **take a picture of it with your phone.** Treat it as if it were toxic to all digital devices.

### ### Rule 2: Write It Down on Paper or Stamp It in Metal

The only safe way to store your seed phrase is offline. Use a pen and paper (most wallets come with a card for this). Write clearly and double-check the words. For long-term security, consider stamping the words onto a metal plate, which protects it from fire and water damage.

### ### Rule 3: Store It In a Secure, Secret Location

Once you've written down your phrase, you must protect the physical paper or metal. Think of it like a bar of gold. Store it in a robust home safe, a bank's safe deposit box, or a very well-hidden location. Some people create two or three copies and store them in different secure locations.

### ### Rule 4: Never Type Your Seed Phrase Into a Website

This is the single most common way people lose their bitcoin to scams. You may get an email or message that looks like it's from your wallet provider, asking you to "verify your wallet" or "sync your account" by entering your 12 words on a website. **This is always a scam.** Your seed phrase is only ever used once: on the screen of your new hardware wallet or phone when you are recovering your funds. That's it.

By following these four simple rules, you can secure your bitcoin with more confidence than any other financial asset in the world.
