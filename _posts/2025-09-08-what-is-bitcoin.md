## The Problem: A Broken System

Before understanding what Bitcoin *is*, it helps to understand the problem it solves. Our current financial system, based on government-issued currencies (like the Shekel or the Dollar), has some well-known challenges. Governments and central banks can print more money whenever they want, which often leads to inflationâ€”the slow erosion of your savings' purchasing power. International transfers can be slow, expensive, and require trusting many intermediaries.

## The Solution: A New Kind of Money

Bitcoin is a new form of digital money. It was created in 2009 by an anonymous person or group known as Satoshi Nakamoto. Unlike traditional money, Bitcoin has a few key properties that make it unique:

* **Decentralized:** No single person, company, or government controls it. It's run by a global network of computers, making it resistant to censorship or shutdown.
* **Fixed Supply:** There will only ever be a maximum of 21 million bitcoin created. This scarcity is built into the code, meaning it cannot be devalued by printing more of it. It's like digital gold.
* **Peer-to-Peer:** You can send it to anyone, anywhere in the world, without needing a bank or other financial institution in the middle.

In short, Bitcoin offers a way to save and transact value in a system that is open, transparent, and predictable.
