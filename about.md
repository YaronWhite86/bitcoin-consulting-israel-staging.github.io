# About Me

My name is Yaron White and I was born in the US. I moved to Israel when I was 23 to volunteer in the IDF. After completing my service I earned my BSc in Electrical Engineering from the Technion in 2019. Since receiving my degree I've worked in the defense and autonomous driving industries.

Like many young families in Israel, my wife and I found ourselves navigating a challenging financial environment. Even as "high-income earners", we felt the pressure and began asking hard questions about why traditional goals, like buying a home, felt so out of reach.

That's what led me to Bitcoin.

My journey started with skepticism, then curiosity, and quickly grew into a passion. As an engineer, I was captivated by the technology's elegance and its potential to offer a real solution. It's been a long and incredibly rewarding process of learning, and now I want to share that knowledge with you. My goal is to help others understand Bitcoin with clarity and confidence, cutting through the noise and focusing on what truly matters for your financial future.
