## Network & Block Explorers

These tools allow you to "look under the hood" and see the Bitcoin network operating in real time.

### Mempool.space – The Live Bitcoin Dashboard 🛰️

Think of this website as a live flight tracker for the entire Bitcoin network. The "mempool" is the digital waiting room where transactions wait to be confirmed. The "blocks" are the planes that carry those transactions to their destination.

On [mempool.space](https://mempool.space), you can watch in real-time as new blocks are discovered and transactions are selected from the waiting room. It's a fascinating, transparent look at the network's heartbeat.

## Recommended Books 📚

Reading is one of the best ways to deepen your understanding of Bitcoin. Here are a few essential books that I highly recommend.

### The Bitcoin Standard by Saifedean Ammous
> This is the foundational book for understanding Bitcoin's economic properties. It brilliantly explains the history of money and makes a powerful case for why Bitcoin is the best form of money humanity has ever had. A must-read.

### Broken Money by Lyn Alden
> Broken Money distills the past, present, and future of money through a tech-first lens, showing how innovations—from telegraphs to Bitcoin—reshape monetary systems and power. With clarity and rigor, Lyn Alden explains why today’s financial plumbing keeps failing people and maps practical paths toward something better.

### The Price of Tomorrow by Jeff Booth
> The Price of Tomorrow argues that relentless, technology-driven deflation is colliding with a debt-soaked, inflation-dependent economy—fueling fragility and inequality. Jeff Booth makes a clear, provocative case for embracing deflation and redesigning money and policy to unlock broad abundance.
