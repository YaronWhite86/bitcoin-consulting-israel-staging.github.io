## Network & Block Explorers

These tools allow you to "look under the hood" and see the Bitcoin network operating in real time.

### Mempool.space ‚Äì The Live Bitcoin Dashboard üõ∞Ô∏è

Think of this website as a live flight tracker for the entire Bitcoin network. The "mempool" is the digital waiting room where transactions wait to be confirmed. The "blocks" are the planes that carry those transactions to their destination.

<p>On <a href="https://mempool.space" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mempool.space</a>, you can watch in real-time as new blocks are discovered and transactions are selected from the waiting room. It's a fascinating, transparent look at the network's heartbeat.</p>
